## 🔄 Next Steps

### Option 1: Update Event Dates (Recommended)
Since some events are in the past, you might want to update their dates:

1. **Via Admin Panel** (Easy):
   - Go to `/admin/events`
   - Click "Edit" on each event
   - Update date to future date
   - Save

2. **Via MongoDB Compass** (Quick):
   ```javascript
   // Update all past events to future dates
   db.events.updateMany(
     { date: { $lt: new Date() } },
     { $set: { date: new Date('2025-11-01') } }
   )
   ```

3. **Via Script** (Bulk):
   - Modify `seedEvents.js`
   - Update dates in `eventsData` array
   - Run: `npm run seed-events-update`

### Option 2: Keep as Historical Data
- Past events show your organization's activity
- Users can see event history
- Good for portfolio/showcasing

### Option 3: Add More Events
Create new events through admin panel:
- Login as admin
- Go to `/admin/events`
- Click "Create Event"
- Fill details & publish

## 🛠️ If You Need to Re-seed

### Clear All & Re-seed (Fresh Start)
```powershell
cd backend
npm run seed-events-clear
```
⚠️ **WARNING**: Deletes ALL events!

### Update Existing Events
```powershell
cd backend
npm run seed-events-update
```
Updates events with matching names, adds new ones

### Add New Events Only (Safe)
```powershell
cd backend
npm run seed-events
```
Skips duplicates, adds only new events
